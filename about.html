			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<div class="aboutText"><font color="white"> At Georgia Tech, students pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science must choose two "threads", which provide a more in-depth perspective regarding certain areas of computer science (e.g. databases, networking, computer security, processors, operating systems, computer graphics, machine learning, etc.). More information about threads can be found <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/computer-science/threads" style="color: white" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. The threads I have chosen are Systems/Architecture and Information Infonetworks. My expected graduation date is December 2018.<br></br>

			I am primarily interested in web and mobile development, but I am eager to become involved in game development in the future.
