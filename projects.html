			<h5>Pokemon Battle Simulator (C) ~ CS 2110</h5>

			<p>At Georgia Tech, CS 2110, or Computer Organization and Programming, is a course that opens students up to computing at the low level by teaching circuitry with relation to logic gates, adders/multiplexors/decoders, and memory, state machines, the LC3 assembly language and its datapath, as well as an introduction to the C language.<br></br>After learning to manipulate images (I/O and on-screen pixels) and objects in C using an emulator for the Game Boy Advance, we were tasked to create a game in C adhering to a list of guidelines, but were nevertheless given the freedom to develop whatever we chose. So I chose the most classic game for the Game Boy; one that I grew up with and hold close to my heart: Pokemon.<br></br>With only a week to develop for the assignment, I obviously could not recreate the entire game, so I decided to simply create the conditions for a Pokemon battle to take place. I needed to take into account the Pokemon and their stats, the impact of an attack (super effective, neutral, not super effective, no effect), the health and life status of every Pokemon in the battle, the options that the user had and could execute, and a RNG for accuracy and damage purposes.<br></br>Pitting you as Red versus your childhood rival Blue (who is now the champion of the Kanto League) in the monumental final Elite Four battle for champion of the Kanto League just like in the original 1996 classic, can you dethrone the champion? Good luck!</p>
			
			<h5>Water Conservation Application (JavaFX) ~ CS 2340</h5>
			<p>The Objects and Design course at GT is a group-oriented course in which teams learn and follow the agile development process while working towards creating an application. In the fall, students use JavaFX to achieve this goal (Android used in spring) and are tasked weekly to conquer some goal (e.g. create login screen, then home screen, then profile screen, and so on.). At the same time, students adhere to design standards by producing content such as use cases, UML class diagrams, UI flow diagrams, and more in the process to assist in development and visually showcase the thought process in development.<br></br>This semester-long project required an implementation of GMapsFX to pinpoint coordinates where users of a certain status would submit water quality information as well as SQL server implementation to provide persistance of our users and water quality information.</p>
